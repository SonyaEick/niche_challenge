# Niche.com Back-End Coding Exercise: <br/> Indexing College Reviews

## Overview
Your task is to write a command line program that creates a basic index of user reviews of colleges and, 
once finished, allows the user to query the index by keyword and see the number of reviews per college
that contained that keyword.  

There are roughly one thousand text files on one of our web servers that we would like to be able to query. 
Each file represents reviews for a particular college. The first line of each text file is the name of a 
college in our system. The rest of the lines in each file are reviews about that college from users who 
have attended the school (one review per line). The URLs for each of these "college review files" are 
specified in [`urls.txt`](urls.txt), which contains one URL per line. 

In [`stopWords.txt`](stopwords.txt) you will find a list of common words, one per line, which you should
exclude from your index.

Your program should:
 1. download the review files specified in [`urls.txt`](urls.txt) and build a search index, ignoring words 
 in [`stopWords.txt`](stopwords.txt)
 1. prompt the user for a search token
 1. return results showing the colleges with reviews matching that token, as well as a count of reviews per
 college
 1. repeat steps 2-3, allowing the user to perform multiple searches
 
Your program should support case-insensitive searches for a single whitespace-delimited, case-insensitive 
token per query.  Some example tokens are:
  ```
  baseball
  baseball,
  full-time
  fun!
  ```

## Instructions
 - Create a branch in this repository to contain your work
 - Implement your solution any language you like, as long as it is well suited to the task at hand.
   Pick a language which you are comfortable with, and which will best allow you to demonstrate your ability.  
 - When ready, submit your solution by making a Github Pull Request from your branch to the `main`
 branch.
 - We ask that you submit your solution within 7 days.
 
## What to focus on
 - Use appropriate data structures for the task at hand. There is no need to code exotic data structures 
 to support full-text search. 
  - Try to minimize the elapsed time from running your program to the user being able to search.  We would 
 like to see that you understand where bottlenecks and latency exist and that you can implement techniques 
 to mitigate their effects.
 - Ensure your code is well structured, readable, and appropriately commented.
 - Include documentation on how to build/run your solution, as well as any an explanation of your thought 
 process or any design decisions you made. Feel free to replace this README.md in your branch.


## Questions?
If you have any questions, feel free to email us (vivan.shah@niche.com).  We are happy to clarify anything that is unclear, but 
we may politely decline to answer any specific questions related to design or implementation.
